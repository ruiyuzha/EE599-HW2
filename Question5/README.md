# HW2-Question5

## Description:

● Write a function that takes a string and two indices i, j as inputs, and then swaps the
character at index i with the one at index j.

○ Example: input: (“TEST”, 0, 1), output: “ETST”

● Write a function that takes a string as an input and reverses its value. The function has
no output. It changes the value of the input parameter.

○ Example: Input: “EE599”, Output: “995EE”

○ You cannot use any new local variable of type string or vector or array. The
reverse should happen in place (i.e. on the input vector).

● Write a function that converts a string to lower case:

○ Example: input: “EE599”, output: “ee599”
