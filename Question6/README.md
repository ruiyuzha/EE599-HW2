# HW2-Question6

## Description:

A palindrome is a word, phrase, or other sequences of characters that reads the same
backward as forward, such as madam, racecar, or the number 10801.

Simple Palindrome: Write a function that accepts a string as input and returns true if the input
is a palindrome and false if it is not.

Approximate palindrome: Sentence-length palindromes may be written when allowances are
made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers (space).

Write a function that can declare the following sentences to be palindromes:

● "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!"

● "Was it a car or a cat I saw?"

● "No 'x' in Nixon".
