# HW2-Question3

## Description:

● Write a function that takes a vector of integers as input. The output is the same vector
(i.e. the function's return type should be void) where all duplicates are removed.

○ Example: before: v=[1, 2, 2, 4], after : v=[1, 2, 4]

○ Solve this for the following cases:

■ You cannot use std::set

■ You can use std::set


● Write a function that takes a vector of integers as input. The output is the same vector
but in reversed order:

○ Example: before: [1, 2, 3], after: [3, 2, 1]


● Write a function that takes a vector of integers as input. The output should be the same
vector where all odd numbers are removed.

○ Example: before: [1, 2, 3], after: [2]


● Write a function that inputs two vectors of integers, and returns a new vector formed by
concatenating the two input vectors.

○ Example: input: ([1, 2, 3], [3, 5, 6]): output: [1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6]


● Write a function that takes two vectors v1 and v2, and returns a new vector that is the
union of the values in v1 and v2.

○ Example: input: (v1=[1, 2, 3], v2=[3, 4, 5]), output = [3]
