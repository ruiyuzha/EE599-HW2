# HW2-Question1

Write several functions with the same name Add using function overloading to satisfy the
following requirements:

● All three functions take 2 parameters as the input.

● If both inputs are integers perform addition and return the result.

● If both inputs are string, concatenate both the strings and return the output.

● If the first input is an integer and the second input is a string or vice-versa your code
should return a string that will hold the concatenated value of both the inputs.

Examples:

● Example: input: (3, 5), output: 8

● Example: input: (“abc”, “efg”), output: “abcdefg”

● Example: input: (“EE”, 599), output: “EE599”
